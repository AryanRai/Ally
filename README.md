Here’s a **merged and polished README** that combines your **Ally** desktop overlay concept with the **DroidCore** robot architecture you gave earlier.
I’ve kept it structured, license-ready, and forward-looking so you can drop it into GitHub as `README.md`.

# Ally – DroidCore Desktop Overlay

**Ally** is a **glassmorphic, picture-in-picture desktop overlay** that provides advanced access to local and remote LLMs, convenience tools for instant actions, and a bridge to the **DroidCore** robotic platform.

It runs as a floating, always-on-top Electron app with Apple-style glass UI, animated interactions, and seamless integration with **Ollama (local models like gpt-oss-20b)**. All chats are logged to a **DigitalOcean-hosted API** with an exposed external domain, enabling persistent conversation history, analytics, and remote control signals for the robot.

---

## About

Ally is designed as both a **personal AI assistant** and a **robot control console**:
- **As a desktop overlay:** quick access to AI chat, search, and task automation without switching windows.
- **As part of DroidCore:** acts as the human-facing “head” of the robot, providing vision, language, and speech interfaces.

It is ideal for:
- Rapid natural-language queries and responses via local LLMs.
- On-the-fly actions (file lookup, system commands, IoT triggers).
- Sending structured “robot intents” to the DroidCore LowLvl control stack.

## Core Features

### Glass PiP Overlay
- **Apple-style glassmorphism:** frosted blur, subtle gradients, rounded corners, hairline borders.
- **Motion-rich interactions:** drag, snap to corners, elastic resize, collapse into a pill, animated open/close.
- **Keyboard accessible:** focus ring, `Esc` to close, `Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+C` to toggle.
- **Persistent layout:** remembers position/size between sessions.

### AI Integration
- **Local Models:** Connects to Ollama (`http://localhost:11434`) for low-latency inference. Default: `gpt-oss:20b`.
- **Remote Models (future):** Optional API bridge to cloud LLMs.
- **Streaming output:** tokens rendered in real-time with smooth animations.
- **Custom prompts & system personas:** switchable in settings.

### Chat Logging
- **DigitalOcean API:** all messages are sent to a dedicated DO droplet.
- **Storage:** PostgreSQL or SQLite+Litestream for persistence.
- **Secure:** API key authentication, HTTPS enforced, optional IP allowlist.
- **Retrieval:** pull past chats for context or analysis.

### Robot Hooks (DroidCore)
- **HighLvl integration:** Ally can send structured commands to the DroidCore robot.
- **Vision/Speech:** hooks for Kinect v2 (via libfreenect2), Whisper STT, Piper TTS, YOLO object detection.
- **Actuation:** transmit movement commands to LowLvl (motor control, FOC, sensor polling).
- **Multi-modal coordination:** combine vision, speech, and LLM reasoning for complex tasks.

If you want, I can now also generate the **matching `LICENSE` file** (Apache-2.0) and **kick-start the repo with folder structure + stubs** so you can open it in Cursor and immediately start coding. That way, your UI, Electron shell, Ollama client, and DO logging API will all be in place from day one.
