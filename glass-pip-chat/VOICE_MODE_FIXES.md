# Voice Mode Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Settings Modal Overflow
**Problem**: The speech settings modal was too large and overflowed the window, making it unusable.

**Solution**: 
- Reduced modal width from `w-80` to `w-72`
- Changed max width from `max-w-full` to `max-w-[90vw]`
- Reduced max height from `max-h-[90vh]` to `max-h-[85vh]`
- Modal now fits properly in all window sizes

### 2. ✅ Removed Separate Settings Icon in Minimized Mode
**Problem**: There was a separate settings icon in collapsed/minimized mode that was redundant.

**Solution**:
- Removed the separate settings button from `CollapsedHeader.tsx`
- Updated the voice toggle button to handle right-click for settings access
- Added visual indicator (small blue dot) on hover to show settings are available
- Voice button now shows: "Click to toggle, right-click for settings"

### 3. ✅ Integrated Speech Settings into Main Settings Panel
**Problem**: Speech settings were in a separate modal instead of being integrated with the main settings that has server status, etc.

**Solution**:
- **Removed** `SpeechSettingsModal.tsx` completely
- **Added** comprehensive speech settings section to main `SettingsModal.tsx`
- **Integrated** with `useSpeechService` hook for real functionality
- **Added** connection status, voice settings, and test functionality
- **Maintained** the same tabbed structure as other settings sections
