# Voice Mode Improvements

## Summary of Changes

This document outlines the improvements made to the voice mode functionality in the glass-pip-chat application.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Voice Mode Icon in Minimized Mode
**Problem**: The voice mode icon in collapsed/minimized mode didn't activate voice mode the same as in maximized mode. It only toggled the visual state but didn't handle speech recognition or TTS.

**Solution**: 
- Updated `CollapsedHeader.tsx` to properly integrate with the speech service
- Added connection status checking before enabling voice mode
- Added visual indicators for connection and voice mode status
- Voice mode toggle now properly enables/disables speech recognition and TTS in both modes

### 2. Missing Speech Settings Panel
**Problem**: There was no comprehensive settings panel for configuring speech service options like reconnection, voice selection, and other parameters.

**Solution**:
- Created a new `SpeechSettingsModal.tsx` component with comprehensive settings
- Added tabbed interface with sections for:
  - **Connection**: WebSocket host/port, auto-reconnect settings
  - **Voice**: Voice selection, speed, pitch, volume controls
  - **Recognition**: Language selection, continuous recognition options
  - **Advanced**: Streaming TTS, GGWave settings, chunk size configuration
- Added keyboard shortcut `Ctrl+Shift+P` to open speech settings
- Settings are persisted to localStorage

### 3. Reconnection and Configuration
**Problem**: No way to reconnect to speech service or configure connection parameters.

**Solution**:
- Added connection/disconnection buttons in settings modal
- Added auto-reconnect functionality with configurable intervals
- Added connection status indicators throughout the UI
- Added reconnect button for manual reconnection

### 4. Voice Selection and Configuration
**Problem**: No way to change voice, adjust speech parameters, or configure TTS settings.

**Solution**:
- Added voice selection dropdown with multiple voice options
- Added sliders for speed, pitch, and volume adjustment
- Added test buttons for TTS and GGWave functionality
- Added streaming TTS configuration options
- Added GGWave frequency and volume controls

## New Features
