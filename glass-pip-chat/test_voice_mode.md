# Voice Mode Toggle Test

## Changes Made

1. **Added Voice Mode Toggle to Collapsed Header**
   - Added Volume2 and VolumeX icons import
   - Added voiceModeEnabled and onVoiceModeToggle props to CollapsedHeader interface
   - Added voice mode toggle button before the model selector
   - Connected the toggle to the main component's voice mode state

2. **TTS Sequential Playing Analysis**
   - Confirmed that TTS is already playing sequentially in `useSpeechService.ts`
   - The `playNextAudioChunk` function ensures sequential playback:
     - Uses `isPlayingRef.current` to track playback state
     - Only starts next chunk after current one completes
     - Adds 100ms delay between chunks for natural flow
     - Continues playing remaining chunks automatically

## Testing Instructions

1. **Voice Mode Toggle Test**
   - Open the app in collapsed mode
   - Look for the new voice mode toggle icon (Volume2/VolumeX) in the header
   - Click to toggle voice mode on/off
   - Icon should change color and appearance based on state
   - Purple background when enabled, gray when disabled

2. **TTS Sequential Test**
   - Enable voice mode
   - Send a long message that will generate multiple TTS chunks
   - Observe that audio plays smoothly without overlapping
   - Each chunk should wait for the previous one to complete

## Implementation Details

- **Voice Mode Toggle**: Located between context indicators and model selector
- **Visual Feedback**: Purple highlight when enabled, gray when disabled
- **Sequential TTS**: Already implemented with proper queue management
- **Interruption Support**: stopCurrentSpeech() clears queue and stops current audio

## Files Modified

1. `Ally/glass-pip-chat/src/components/chat/CollapsedHeader.tsx`
   - Added voice mode toggle button
   - Added required props and imports

2. `Ally/glass-pip-chat/src/components/GlassChatPiP.tsx`
   - Added voice mode props to CollapsedHeader usage

## TTS Sequential Playback Confirmation

The TTS system is already properly implemented for sequential playback:

```typescript
const playNextAudioChunk = useCallback(async () => {
  if (isPlayingRef.current || audioQueueRef.current.length === 0) {
    return; // Don't start if already playing or no chunks
  }

  isPlayingRef.current = true;
  
  try {
    const audioData = audioQueueRef.current.shift();
    if (audioData) {
      await playGeneratedSpeech(audioData); // Wait for completion
      await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 100)); // Natural delay
    }
  } finally {
    isPlayingRef.current = false;
    
    // Continue with next chunk if available
    if (audioQueueRef.current.length > 0) {
      setTimeout(() => playNextAudioChunk(), 50);
    }
  }
}, [playGeneratedSpeech]);
```

This ensures that:
- Only one audio chunk plays at a time
- Each chunk waits for the previous to complete
- Natural delays prevent robotic speech
- Queue is processed sequentially
